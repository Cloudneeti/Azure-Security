# Incident Response Management

Many organizations learn how to respond to security incidents only after suffering an attack. To reduce costs and damage, itâ€™s important to have an incident response plan in place before an attack takes place. You can use Azure Security Center in different stages of an incident response.

An effective plan depends on three core capabilities: being able to protect, detect, and respond to threats. Protection is about preventing incidents, detection is about identifying threats early, and response is about evicting the attacker and restoring systems to mitigate the impacts of a breach.

The following diagram illustrates the security incident response stages:
