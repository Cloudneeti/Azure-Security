# Incident Response Management

Many organizations learn how to respond to security incidents only after suffering an attack. To reduce costs and damage, itâ€™s important to have an incident response plan in place before an attack takes place. You can use Azure Security Center in different stages of an incident response.

An effective plan depends on three core capabilities: being able to protect, detect, and respond to threats. Protection is about preventing incidents, detection is about identifying threats early, and response is about evicting the attacker and restoring systems to mitigate the impacts of a breach.

The following diagram illustrates the security incident response stages:

## Guidance
In a typical incident response plan you will have the following phases as part of the plan:

1. Initial assessment.
2. Incident communication.
3. Damage control and risk reduction.
4. Identification of what it was compromise and severity.
5. Evidence preservation.
6. Notification to appropriate parties.
7. System recovery.
8. Documentation.
9. Damage and cost assessment.
10. Process and plan revision.
