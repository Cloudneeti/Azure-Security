# Patching


Retrieves a daily list of available security and critical updates from Windows Update or Windows Server Update Services. The retrieved list depends on the service that's configured for your virtual machines, and it recommends that missing updates be applied. For Linux systems, the policy uses the distro-provided package-management system to determine packages that have available updates. It also checks for security and critical updates from Azure Cloud Services virtual machines.
