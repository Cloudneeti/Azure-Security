# Authentication

The foundation of security for most organizations is based on authentication methods used to securely provide access to its end users and customers to its applications and systems. In Azure there are different types of authentication methods that can be implemented to help ensure the security of your application and its data:

1. [Azure Multi-Factor Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/multi-factor-authentication): This is Microsoft's two-step verification solution. Azure MFA provides a range of verification methods that include phone call, text message or mobile app verification.  MFA can be implemented in the [Cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted) or [On-Premise](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfaserver-deploy)

2. [AD FS in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-azure-adfs#design-principles): AD FS provides simplified, secured identity federation and Web single sign-on (SSO) capabilities. Federation with Azure AD or O365 enables users to authenticate using on-premise.

3. [Pass-through Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication): Allows your users to sign in to both on-premises and cloud-based applications using the same passwords.


## Guidance 
Use the following guidance when considering an authentication method based on your business requirements

### For Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (Azure MFA)

- Before choosing a method to implement MFA, review the following to determine your solution requirements: 

    - [What am I trying to Secure?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-whichversion#what-am-i-trying-to-secure)
    - [Where Are The Users Located?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-whichversion#where-are-the-users-located) 
    - [What Features Do I Need?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-whichversion#what-features-do-i-need) 

### For AD FS in Azure

- Use the following guides to plan a secure AD FS deployment: 
  - [Core Security Practices for AD FS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/design/best-practices-for-secure-planning-and-deployment-of-ad-fs#core-security-best-practices-for-ad-fs)
  - [SQL Server Specific Best Practices for AD FS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/design/best-practices-for-secure-planning-and-deployment-of-ad-fs#sql-serverspecific-security-best-practices-for-ad-fs)

- AD FS and Web Application Proxy hardware requirements are gated on CPU; size your farm for processing capacity. 

- Whether you deploy AD FS on on-premise or on Azure, have a high-available AD FS infrastructure. Build two AD FS servers and two Web Application Proxy (WAP) servers (in the DMZ). Use one AD FS Server and one WAP Server as the primary active node. Use one ADFS and one WAP server as a secondary node in passive/staging mode. 

- For deployment of AD FS on-premises, use the standard deployment topology as described in:  [Best practices for securing Active Directory Federation Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs#standard-deployment-topology). 


### For Pass-Through Authentication

- To avoid user sign-in failures, configure Pass-through Authentication for high availability. Consider installing two to three  authentication agents for [high availability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-quick-start#step-5-ensure-high-availability) and capacity.  

- Install authentication agents close to your domain controllers to improve sign-in latency. 

- Consider implementing password writeback on your on-premises active directory so that if a user signs in by using Pass-through Authentication, they can change or reset their passwords. The passwords are written back to the on-premises Active Directory as expected. 

## Preparation Steps

Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks:

### For Azure Multi-Factor Authentication

- Ensure you have licenses for Azure MFA, Azure AD Premium or Enterprise Mobility and Security. If you do not have licenses, create an Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Provider to take full advantage of the features provided by Azure MFA. 
- [Create an MFA Provider ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-authprovider#create-an-mfa-provider) to require two-step verification for your users


### For AD FS in Azure
- If you do not have AD FS implemented, refer to the requirements and prerequisites, see: [AD FS Requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/overview/ad-fs-requirements).  
 
- Check the [Ports Required](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs#ports-required) prior to deploying AD FS. 

- Configure your firewall to connect to Office 365: [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2) 

### For Pass-Through Authentication

- Check the prerequisites for the [Azure Active Directory Admin centre](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-quick-start#in-the-azure-active-directory-admin-center) and your [on-premises environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-quick-start#in-your-on-premises-environment).
