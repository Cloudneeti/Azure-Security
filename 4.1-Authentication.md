# Authentication

The foundation of security for most organizations is based on authentication methods used to securely provide access to its end users and customers to its applications and systems. In Azure there are different types of authentication methods that can be implemented to help ensure the security of your application and its data:

1. [Azure Multi-Factor Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/multi-factor-authentication): Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is Microsoft's two-step verification solution. Azure MFA provides a range of verification methods that include phone call, text message or mobile app verification.  MFA can be implemented in the [Cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted) or [On-Premise](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfaserver-deploy)

2. [ADFS in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-azure-adfs#design-principles): AD FS provides simplified, secured identity federation and Web single sign-on (SSO) capabilities. Federation with Azure AD or O365 enables users to authenticate using on-premise.

3. [Pass-through Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication): Allows your users to sign in to both on-premises and cloud-based applications using the same passwords.

4. [Password Hash Synchronization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnectsync-implement-password-hash-synchronization): Password hash synchronization is a feature used to synchronize user passwords from an on-premises Active Directory instance to a cloud-based Azure AD instance. Use this feature to sign in to Azure AD services like Office 365, Microsoft Intune, CRM Online, and Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS).
