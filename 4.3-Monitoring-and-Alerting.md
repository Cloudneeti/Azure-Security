# Monitoring and Alerting

We often think of monitoring as watching and waiting for an event to occur so that we can react to the situation. Security monitoring refers to having a proactive strategy that audits your resources to identify systems that do not meet organizational standards or best practices.

With Azure, there are security tools/features that are available to you to aid you in monitoring, auditing, logging and alerting of any issues to your resources that host your systems. These tools are:

 -  [OMS Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-overview?toc=%2fazure%2foperations-management-suite%2ftoc.json): is a feature under the Operation Management Suite (OMS) that gives you the ability to obtain detailed insights into the activities happening in your Azure environment. With log analytics you can:
     - see operational activities aggregated by status 
     - view trends of activities happening on each of your Azure services 
     - report on authorization changes on all your Azure resources 
     - identify outages or service health issues impacting your resources 
     - use its [query language](https://docs.loganalytics.io/index) to quickly retrieve, consolidate, analyze and create [security alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-managing-and-responding-alerts) from collected data from Azure resources across multiple subscriptions. 

 - [Network Watcher](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview#network-watcher) Scenario-based monitoring is provided with the features in Network Watcher. Scenario level monitoring provides an end to end view of network resources in contrast to individual network resource monitoring. The Network Watcher service includes: 
     - [Topology](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/view-network-topology): to learn how to view resources in a Microsoft Azure virtual network, and the relationships between the resources
     - [Packet Capture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-packet-capture-overview): to create packet capture sessions to track traffic to and from a virtual machine. Packet capture helps to diagnose network anomalies both reactively and proactivity
     - [Next Hop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-next-hop-overview): to help you figure out if traffic is being directed to the intended destination, or whether the traffic is being sent nowhere.
     - [IP Flow Verify](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-ip-flow-verify-overview): to checks if a packet is allowed or denied to or from a virtual machine.
     - view trends of activities happening on each of your Azure services
