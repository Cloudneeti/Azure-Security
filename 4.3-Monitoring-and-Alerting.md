# Monitoring and Alerting

We often think of monitoring as watching and waiting for an event to occur so that we can react to the situation. Security monitoring and alerting is important to have a proactive strategy in place that audits your resources to identify systems that do not meet organizational standards or best practices.

With Azure, not only are there tools/features available to you to monitor your resources but there are logging and alerting mechanisms that can be enforced to ensure that as administrators, you are alerted of an issue instead of reacting to an issue.
