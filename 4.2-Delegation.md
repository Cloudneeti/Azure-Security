# Delegation
Azure has two types of role based access controls (RBAC) that can help your organization designate administrators to serve different functions:

- **Azure AD RBAC Roles**: These role assignments have access to various features. Depending on their administrator role they can create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, and manage domains. Examples of these roles include Global Administrator, Billing Administrator, Security Administrator.
- **Azure RBAC Roles**: These role assignments allow you to control access to resources in Azure. You canâ€™t modify the built-in roles, but you can create your own [custom roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles to fit the specific needs of your organization. Examples of these roles include: Owner, Contributor, Reader.


 

## Guidance for Azure AD RBAC Roles

Use the following guidance to help kick-start your planning process for Azure AD RBAC Roles: 

 

- Start planning the roles as described in: [Top 5 Azure AD RBAC Roles](https://github.com/nmcgregor/Azure-Security/blob/master/4.2.2-Top-5-Azure-AD-RBAC-Roles).
 

- When planning roles, compile a list of users or groups who require access. Using the list, identify the Azure AD role assignment for each user/group.  

- Use a Least Privileged Access model. Implementing this model will ensure that you allocate sufficient privileges to accomplish specified functions, but no more.  

- Minimize the number of people that are [Global Administrators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles-azure-portal#details-about-the-global-administrator-role). 

- Implement [Just in time administration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure#just-in-time-administrator-access) and manage roles using [Azure AD PIM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure). 


## Guidance for Azure RBAC Roles

Use the following guidance to help kick-start your planning process for Azure RBAC roles:

- Start planning with the [Top 10 Built-In Azure RBAC Roles](https://github.com/nmcgregor/Azure-Security/blob/master/4.2.3-Top-10-Built-In-Azure-RBAC-Roles) to avoid complexity. Complexity is usually a result of defining too many roles. 

- When planning roles, compile a list of users or groups who require access. Start small with key foundational roles and add roles as needed.

- Control the Admin/Co-Admin of a subscription using a managed identity. Don't assign Admin/Co-admin to a new subscription 
owner. Instead, use RBAC roles to provide owner rights to a group or individual. 

- Add Azure users to a group (for example, Application X Owners) in Active Directory. Use the synchronized group to provide 
group members with the appropriate rights to manage the resource group containing the application

- Follow the principle of granting the least privilege required to do the expected work. For example:
   - Deployment Group: Create a deployment group that is only able to deploy resources. 
   - Virtual Machine Management: Create a virtual machine group that is only able to restart VMs (for operations) 

- Implement [Just in time administration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure#just-in-time-administrator-access) 

- Use Built-In Roles before Custom Roles. There are two primary reasons why these Custom Roles should be used: 
    - There is no existing built-in role to provide the role needed. 
    - An existing built-in role may exist, but gives away too many rights, and there is a need to reduce the rights to just the 
bare minimum 

## Procedure for Azure AD RBAC Roles

Use this procedure to learn how to assign an administrative role to a user in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):

1. Sign in to the [Azure AD admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com/) with an account that's a global administrator for the directory.

2. Follow the steps to [Assign an Azure AD RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal) role o a user. 


## Procedure for Azure RBAC Roles

Use this procedure to view, add or remove RBAC assignments. The Subscription Owner uses Azure Portal. Refer to 
Baseline Azure Roles for recommended patterns. 

 
1. Sign into the [Azure Portal](https://ea.azure.com) with an accoount that has subscription owner rights.

2. Perform any of the following: 

   - To add access: [Use Role-Based Access Control to manage access to your Azure subscription resources - 
     Add Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal?toc=%252fazure%252factive-directory%252ftoc.json#add-access) 

   - To view access:  [Use Role-Based Access Control to manage access to your Azure subscription 
     resources - View Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal?toc=%252fazure%252factive-directory%252ftoc.json#view-access) 

   - To remove access: [Use Role-Based Access Control to manage access to your Azure subscription 
     resources - Remove Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal?toc=%252fazure%252factive-directory%252ftoc.json#remove-access)
