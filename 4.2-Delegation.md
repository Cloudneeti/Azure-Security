# Delegation
Azure has two types of role based access controls (RBAC) that can help your organization designate administrators to serve different functions:

- **Azure AD RBAC Roles**: These role assignments have access to various features. Depending on their administrator role they can create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, and manage domains. Examples of these roles include Global Administrator, Billing Administrator, Security Administrator.
- **Azure RBAC Roles**: These role assignments allow you to control access to resources in Azure. You canâ€™t modify the built-in roles, but you can create your own [custom roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles to fit the specific needs of your organization. Examples of these roles include: Owner, Contributor, Reader.


 

## Guidance for Azure AD RBAC Roles

Use the following guidance to help kick-start your planning process for Azure AD RBAC Roles: 

 

- Start planning the roles as described in: Top 5 Azure AD RBAC Roles. [Designing your Delegation Model](https://github.com/nmcgregor/Azure-Security/blob/master/4.2.1-Design-your-Delegation-Model.md).

 

- When planning roles, compile a list of users or groups who require access. Using the list, identify the Azure AD role assignment for each user/group. 

 

- Use a Least Privileged Access model. Implementing this model will ensure that you allocate sufficient privileges to accomplish specified functions, but no more. 

 

- Minimize the number of people that are [Global Administrators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles-azure-portal#details-about-the-global-administrator-role).
 

- Implement [Just in time administration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure#just-in-time-administrator-access) and manage roles using [Azure AD PIM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure). 


## Guidance for Azure RBAC Roles

Use the following guidance to help kick-start your planning process for Azure RBAC roles:

- Start with top 10 most common roles and avoid complexity. Complexity is usually a result of defining too many roles.

## Procedure for Azure AD RBAC Roles

Use this procedure to learn how to assign an administrative role to a user in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):
