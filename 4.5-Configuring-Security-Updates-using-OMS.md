# Configuring Security Updates using OMS

For organizations, keeping their systems and applications up-to-date with the latest security patches/updates is critical in ensuring that their systems are not compromised by any security breaches.

In Azure, [OMS Update Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-update-management) allows you to manage operating system updates for your Windows and Linux computers deployed in Azure, on-premises environments, or other cloud providers. You can quickly assess the status of available updates on all agent computers and manage the process of installing required updates for servers.

The following diagram shows a conceptual view of the behavior and data flow with how the Update Management solution assesses and applies security updates to all connected Windows Server and Linux computers in a OMS workspace:

## Preparation
  - Review the list of [Supported](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-update-management#supported-client-types) and [Unsupported](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-update-management#unsupported-client-types) operating systems
  - Review and understand the client requirements for [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-update-management#windows) and [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-update-management#linux).
  - Understand the [Permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-role-based-access-control#update-management) required for managing update management deployments
 
## Guidance
  - Ensure that you are the subscrition owner of your subscription and [Create an OMS Workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-quick-create-workspace).  
  - Ensure you create an [Automation Runbook](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-quickstart-create-account) to action the tasks from update management.

## Procedure
Use the following procedure on how to add and enabled Update Management in OMS:

 1. Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
 
 2. [Enable Update Management for Virtual Machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/manage-update-multi#enable-update-management-for-azure-virtual-machines)
     
 3. [Schedule an Update Deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-tutorial-update-management#schedule-an-update-deployment)
 
 4. [Configure Alerts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/automation/automation-tutorial-update-management#configure-alerting) to let you know when updates are successfully deployed
