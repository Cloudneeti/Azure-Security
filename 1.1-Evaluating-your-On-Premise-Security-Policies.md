# Evaluating your On-Premises Security Policies 

Use the information in section to evaluate the on-premesis security policies needed to secure your organization's systems, applications and network.

A security policy comprises of objectives for your organization, rules for your end users and administrators to adhere by and requirements for systems and applications to follow to ensure the security foundation of your organization. 
----
**Suggestion:**  
Consider the following when building your organization's security policy:
- objectives (what kind of objectives - to do what?)
- systems and applications infrastructure that support the objectives
- rules for your end-users and administrators that govern and support the security fundamentals as defined by the objectives and system infrastructure

Can these questions be categorized - I tried, but not sure if appropriate?

**New:** *Use the questions listed below to analyze your objectives and requirements. Use the analysis results to plan your security policies.*


Access: 
- How do end users and customers access your systems and applications? 
- Do you have security policies around privileged access controls for the applications and systems that house sensitive and proprietary data? 
- What types of security controls are implemented for Identity and Access Management of your user accounts? How are they enforced on your systems/applications? 

Governance:
- What are your current security policies around your existing systems and applications? 
- What are your network security policies? 

Data protection:
- What are your data protection and retention policies? What are your data classification policies? 
- What are your security policies around security updates and patching of your systems and applications? 
- What are you security policies around segregation of customer data?
