# Top 10 Baseline Azure Security Policies
Use the guidance as described in this section to configure your Azure baseline security policies. Use the procedures as described in this section to deploy the following types of baseline security policies:

- Geo-Compliant/Data Sovereignty Baseline Policy
- Cost Management Baseline Policy
- Required Tags Baseline Policy
<br />
<br />
As your organization's security and compliance policies evolve, more azure policies are required.  
<br />
<br />

## Guidance  
Use the information in the table below as a guideline when creating Azure policies. The table contains the top 10 Azure built-in policies you can use to begin defining your policies. 

| __Policy__ | __Definition__ |__Scope__ | __Parameters__ |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| [Enforce Tag and Its Value](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/scripts/enforce-tag-val)  | Requires a tag and a value to be applied to a resource   | Apply to resources within Resource Group  | i.e. costCode, businessowner, vmRole, compositeApp, vmWorkload, deploymentStage | 
| [Enforce Allowed Locations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/scripts/allowed-locs)     | Ensures that only approved locations are used when deploying resources to a region | Apply to subscription or to Resource Group    | i.e. Canada Central, Canada East 
| [Enforce Not Allowed Types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/scripts/not-allowed-res-type#sample-template)       | This policy prohibits the deployment of specified resource types. Specify an array of the resource types to block  | Applies to whatever Resource Group that contains references that you do not you do not want to be accessible through the internet     | i.e. Microsoft.network/PublicIPAddresses
| Monitor VM Vulnerabilities in Security Center (In Preview)     | Monitors vulnerabilities detected by vulnerability assessment solution and VMs without a vulnerability assessment solution in Azure Security Center as recommendations.   | Subscription  | Not Applicable
| Monitor Unprotected Web Application in Security Center (In Preview)        | Web applications without a web application firewall protection will be monitored  by Azure security center as recommendations  | Subscription | Not Applicable|
| Monitor Permissive Network Access in Security Center (In Preview)       | Network security groups with rules that are too permissive will be monitored by Azure security center as recommendations | Subscription | Not Applicable|
| Monitor Missing System Updates (In Preview)     | Missing security system updates on your servers will be monitored by Azure security center as recommendations. | Subscription | Not Applicable|
| Monitor Unprotected Network Endpoints (In Preview)     | Network endpoints without Next Generation firewall protection will be monitored by Azure security center as recommendations.  | Subscription | Not Applicable|
| Monitor Missing Endpoint Protection (In Preview)     | Servers installed without an installed endpoint protection agent will be monitored by Azure security center as recommendations   | Subscription | Not Applicable|
|Monitor OS Vulnerabilities OS    | Servers which do not satisfy the configured baseline will be monitored by Azure security center as recommendations   | Subscription | Not Applicable|

## Procedure:  How to Deploy a Geo-Compliant/Data Sovereignty Baseline Policy    
Use this procedure to build a baseline policy based on geographical or sovereign considerations.  

1. Access the policy definition:   
  Azure Quickstart > Azure Policy > Samples > [Allowed Locations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/scripts/allowed-locs)  

2. Deploy the policy to Azure:   
  [Azure Template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/scripts/allowed-locs#sample-template) | [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/scripts/allowed-locs#deploy-with-powershell) | [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/scripts/allowed-locs#deploy-with-azure-cli)

3. Assign the policy to Azure:   
  [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/new-azurermpolicyassignment?view=azurermps-5.1.1#examples)

4. Define the policy parameters  
  Use the following parameter values:   
   - canadacentral, canadaeast, centralus,   
   - eastus, eastus2,   
   - northcentralus, southcentralus,  
   - westus, westcentralus, westus2
<br />
<br />

## Procedure:  How to Deploy a Cost Management Baseline Policy   
Use this procedure to build a baseline policy based on cost management.    

1. Access the policy definition using: Azure Quickstart > Azure Policy > Samples > [Not Allowed Resource Types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/scripts/not-allowed-res-type)  

2. Deploy the policy to Azure using: [Azure Template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/scripts/not-allowed-res-type#sample-template) | [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/scripts/not-allowed-res-type#deploy-with-powershell) | [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/scripts/not-allowed-res-type#deploy-with-azure-cli)

3. Assign the policy to Azure using: [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/azurerm.resources/new-azurermpolicyassignment?view=azurermps-5.1.1#examples)

4. Define the policy parameters  
  Use the following parameter values:  
   - Standard_G1, Standard_G2, Standard_G3, Standard_G4, Standard_G5  
   - Standard_GS1, Standard_GS2, Standard_GS3, Standard_GS4, Standard_GS5, Standard_GS5-8, Standard_GS5-16   
   - Microsoft.HDInsight/clusters

    **Note**: Available VMs: get-azurevmsize <location>
<br />
<br />

## Procedure:  How to Deploy a Required Tags Baseline Policy   
Use this procedure to build a baseline policy based on required tags.  

1. Access the policy definition:  
  Azure Quickstart > Azure Policy > Samples > [Enforce Tag](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/scripts/enforce-tag-val)  

2. Deploy the policy to Azure:  
  [Azure Template](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/scripts/enforce-tag-val#sample-template) | [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/scripts/enforce-tag-val#deploy-with-powershell) | [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/scripts/enforce-tag-val#deploy-with-azure-cli)
