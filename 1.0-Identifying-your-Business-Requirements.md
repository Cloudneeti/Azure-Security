# Identifying your Business Requirements

Use the information in this section to analyze and evaluate your organization's business requirements.  
â€¯ 

Your business requirements drive the underlying security architecture of your Azure cloud services. Analyze your requirements and plan your security framework accordingly. 

Refer to, and use the following in sequence to evaluate and prepare your network security and compliance policies:

- [Evaluating your On-Premises Security Policies](https://github.com/nmcgregor/Azure-Security/blob/master/1.1-Evaluating-your-On-Premise-Security-Policies.md):  Evaluate the security policies needed to secure your organization's systems, applications and network.

- [Evaluating your On-Premises Compliance Policies](https://github.com/nmcgregor/Azure-Security/blob/master/1.2-Evaluating-your-On-Premise-Compliance-Policies.md): Evaluate your organization's current and future compliance policy needs.
<br />

*The questions below shouldn't be in this section. This is analysis stuff. Do these specifically apply to evaluating security or compliance policies?*  

Use the questions listed below together with feedback from your lines of business (LOB) as the basis of your analysis. Use the analysis results to plan your design and build the security framework for your cloud infrastructure.

- What do you require to support security for your systems and/or business applications?

- Will any system or application house sensitive or proprietary data? What controls are required to ensure data security?

- What do you require to provide for and support controlled, secure access for your applications?

- How do you monitor the security events of your existing systems and/or applications? What are the security tools in place to monitor such events?
