# Identifying Your Business Requirements

Use the information in this section to analyze and evaluate your organization's business requirements.  
â€¯ 

Your business requirements drive the underlying security architecture of your Azure cloud services. 

Analyze your requirements and plan your security framework accordingly. Use the questions listed below together with feedback from your lines of business (LOB) to form your analysis. Use the analysis results to plan your design and build the security framework for your cloud infrastructure.


- What are your line of business requirements around securing their systems and/or business applications? 
**What do your LOBs need to secure their systems and/or business applications?*

- Do any of your systems or applications house sensitive or proprietary data? If so, what security controls are in place to ensure the security of the data? 
**Will any system or application house sensitive or proprietary data? If so, what controls are currently in place or required to ensure data security?*

- What are your existing business requirements around access security controls or your applications? 
**What are your business requirements for access security control?*

**What are your business requirements for your applications?*


- What are your business requirements around monitoring the security events of your systems/applications?
