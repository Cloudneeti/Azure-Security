# Configuring Azure Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

As an organization you need to adopt a business continunity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy that keeps your data safe, and your apps and workloads up and running, when planned and unplanned outages occur.

Site Recovery is an Azure service that contributes to your BCDR strategy. Site Recovery helps ensure business continuity by keeping business apps and workloads running during outages. Site Recovery replicates workloads running on physical and virtual machines (VMs) from a primary site to a secondary location. When an outage occurs at your primary site, you fail over to secondary location, and access apps from there. After the primary location is running again, you can fail back to it.

With Site Recovery, you can do the following:
  - Manage Azure VMs replicating between Azure regions.
  - Manage On-premises VMs and physical servers replicating to Azure, or to a secondary site.
  
Site Recovery can also help create disaster recovery solutions by integrating with Microsoft applications as well as 3rd party applications. Such applications include [SharePoint](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-workload#protect-sharepoint), [Exchange](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Exchange-DR-Solution-using-11a7dcb6), [Dynamics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-dynamicsax), [SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-sql), [Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-workload#replicate-active-directory-and-dns), [SAP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-sap).


## Preparation Steps
- [Prepare Azure resources for replication of on-premises machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/tutorial-prepare-azure)
- If you are using VMWare, [Prepare your on-premises VMware servers for Disaster Recovery to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-tutorial-prepare-on-premises)
- If you are using Hyper-V, [Prepare on-premises Hyper-V servers for Disaster Recovery to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/hyper-v-prepare-on-premises-tutorial)
- Review the [support requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/azure-to-azure-support-matrix) for all components.
 
## Guidance

- Use [Recovery Plans](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/site-recovery-create-recovery-plans) in Azure Site Recovery to help you create and customize a systematic recovery plan. For example, defining how machines fail over, and the sequence in which they start after failover. You can use recovery plans to do the following:
  - [Model an app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/recovery-plan-overview#model-apps) around its dependencies.
  - [Automate recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/recovery-plan-overview#automate-tasks) tasks to reduce RTO.
  - Verify that you're prepared for migration or disaster recovery by ensuring that your apps are part of a recovery plan.
  - Run [test failover](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/recovery-plan-overview#test-failover) on recovery plans, to ensure disaster recovery or migration is working as expected.
