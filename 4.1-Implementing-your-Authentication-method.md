# Implementing your Azure Authentication Method
Use the information and procedure described in this section to implement one of three authentication methods. Use these methods to provide secure user access to your Azure network applications and systems.
<br />
<br />

Security for most organizations is based on the authentication methods used to provide secure, end-user access to applications and systems. 

In Azure, there are three different types of authentication methods used to ensure the security of your applications and data:

1. [Azure Multi-Factor Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/multi-factor-authentication): This method is Microsoft's two-step verification solution. Azure MFA provides a range of verification methods that include phone call, text message or mobile app verification. MFA can be implemented in the [Cloud](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfa-getstarted) or [On-Premise](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-mfaserver-deploy)

2. [AD FS in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-azure-adfs#design-principles): AD FS provides simplified, secure identity federation and Web single sign-on (SSO) capabilities. Federating with Azure AD or Office 365 enables users to authenticate using on-premises.

3. [Pass-through Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication): Use this method to enable user sign-in to both on-premises and cloud-based applications using a single password.
<br />
<br />


## Guidance 
Use the following information when considering an authentication method.
<br />

**Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (Azure MFA) considerations**:  
Before choosing a method to implement MFA, review the following to determine your solution requirements: 

  - [What am I trying to Secure?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-whichversion#what-am-i-trying-to-secure)
  - [Where Are The Users Located?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-whichversion#where-are-the-users-located) 
  - [What Features Do I Need?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-whichversion#what-features-do-i-need) 
<br />

**AD FS in Azure considerations**:  
- Use the following guides to plan a secure AD FS deployment: 
  - [Core Security Practices for AD FS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/design/best-practices-for-secure-planning-and-deployment-of-ad-fs#core-security-best-practices-for-ad-fs)
  - [SQL Server Specific Best Practices for AD FS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/design/best-practices-for-secure-planning-and-deployment-of-ad-fs#sql-serverspecific-security-best-practices-for-ad-fs)

- AD FS and Web Application Proxy hardware requirements are gated on CPU. Size your farm for processing capacity. 

- For either AD FS deployments on-premise or on Azure, implement a high-available AD FS infrastructure. Build two AD FS servers and two Web Application Proxy (WAP) servers (in the DMZ). Use one set (AD FS + WAP servers) as the primary, active node. Use the remaining AD FS and WAP server set as a secondary node operating in passive/staging mode. 

- For deployment of AD FS on-premises, use the standard deployment topology as described in:  [Best practices for securing Active Directory Federation Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs#standard-deployment-topology). 
<br />

**Pass-Through Authentication considerations**:
- To avoid user sign-in failures, [configure Pass-through Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-quick-start) for high availability. Consider installing 2-3  authentication agents for [high availability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-quick-start#step-5-ensure-high-availability) and capacity.  

- Install authentication agents close to your domain controllers to reduce sign-in latency. 

- Consider enabling password writeback on your on-premises active directory. If users sign-in using Pass-through Authentication, they can change or reset their passwords. The passwords are written back to the on-premises Active Directory. 
<br />
<br />

## Preparation
Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks:

**Azure Multi-Factor Authentication preparation**:

- Ensure you have licenses for Azure MFA, Azure AD Premium or Enterprise Mobility and Security. If you do not have licenses, create an Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Provider to take full advantage of the features provided by Azure MFA. 
- [Create an MFA Provider ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-authprovider#create-an-mfa-provider) to require two-step verification for your users
<br />

**AD FS in Azure preparation**:
- If you do not have AD FS implemented, refer to the requirements and prerequisites, see: [AD FS Requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/overview/ad-fs-requirements).  
 
- Validate the [Ports required](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/best-practices-securing-ad-fs#ports-required) prior to deploying AD FS. 

- Configure your firewall to connect to Office 365: [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2) 
<br />

**Pass-Through Authentication preparation**:

- Check the prerequisites for the [Azure Active Directory Admin centre](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-quick-start#in-the-azure-active-directory-admin-center) and your [on-premises environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/connect/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-quick-start#in-your-on-premises-environment).
