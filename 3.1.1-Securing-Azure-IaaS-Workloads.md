# Securing Azure IaaS Workloads
Use the information described in this section to secure workloads when using the Information as a Service (IaaS) scenario.
<br />
<br />

Security requirements can vary for different types of workloads.  When you move to Azure IaaS, you can apply your expertise in securing virtual environments and use a new set of options to help secure your assets. 
<br />
<br />

## Guidance 
- Implement [Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/securing-privileged-access/privileged-access-workstations). PAWs are protected from Internet attacks and threat vectors and are well suited to perform sensitive tasks.  

- Use [Multi-Factor authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/multi-factor-authentication) to safeguard access to data and applications and accomodate a simple sign-in process.  

- [Limit and constrain administrative access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-iaas#limit-and-constrain-administrative-access) to ensure that you secure the accounts that manage your IaaS workloads. For example, you can use [Privileged Identity Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure) to manage, monitor, and control access in your organization. By limiting the number of actors using the system you thereby maintain awareness of individual activities in your organization. Limited access introduces the concept of eligible adminstrators and just-in-time administration to Azure AD. 

- Use [DevTest labs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devtest-lab/devtest-lab-overview) for testing and development purposes. DevTest uses [Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) to segregate duties into roles and grants only the level of access necessary for users to do their jobs. RBAC comes with predefined roles (owner, lab user, and contributor).  

- [Control and limit endpoint access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-iaas#control-and-limit-endpoint-access) to minimize risk of unauthorized access. You can use a VPN option (Site-to-Site) to reconfigure the access control lists on the NSGs and to disallow access to management endpoints from the Internet.

- Use a key management solution such as [Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/key-vault-whatis) to securely store encryption keys and small secrets (e.g. passwords), for your Azure resources in the hardware security module (HSM) .

- Use a centralized security management system such as [Security Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/security-center/) and [Operations Management Suite Security and Compliance](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/security-center/) to monitor your servers for events or activities that might be considered as security concerns (patching, configuration events)  

- Manage your virtual machines by [security hardening](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-iaas#harden-systems) the operating systems, [installing anti-malware](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-antimalware) and [installing the latest security updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-iaas#install-the-latest-security-updates)
