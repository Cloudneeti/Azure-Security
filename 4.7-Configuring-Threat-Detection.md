# Configuring Threat Detection
Use the information and procedure described in this section to configure Security Center to detect threats or attacks on you Azure resources.
<br />
<br />

Use Azure Security Center's capabilities to:  
- Identify active threats to your Azure resources
- Create alerts for those threats 
- Quickly respond to security breaches

Security Center threat detection works by automatically collecting security information from your Azure resources, the network, and connected partner solutions. Security Center analyzes this information, often correlating information from multiple sources, to identify threats. Security alerts are prioritized in Security Center along with recommendations on how to remediate the threat.
<br />
<br />

The figure below illustrates how Security Center interacts within your environment. To build this threat intelligence, Security Center uses data that comes from multiple sources within Microsoft. Security Center uses this data to identify potential threats against your environment. The Threat intelligence pane is composed of three major options:

- Detected threat types
- Threat origin
- Threat intelligence map

Azureâ€™s security incident response is implemented using a five-stage process: Detect, Assess, Diagnose, Stabilize, and Close. An overview of the security incident response process is below:

<br />
<br />

## Guidance
- One of the steps of a security incident response process is to identify the severity of the compromised system(s). In this phase, you should perform the following tasks:

  - Determine the nature of the attack.
  - Determine the attack point of origin.
  - Determine the intent of the attack. Was the attack directed at your organization to acquire specific information, or was it random?
  - Identify the systems that were compromised.
  - Identify the files that were accessed and determine the sensitivity of those files.
  - You can use threat intelligence information in Security Center to help with these tasks.

- [Access Threat Intelligence](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-threat-intel#access-the-threat-intelligence) to visualize the current threat intelligence for your environment.

## Preparation
- Ensure you have [Created an OMS Workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-quick-create-workspace) and [Added the Azure Activity log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-activity#configuration) solution.

- Advanced detections are available in the [Standard Tier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-pricing) of Azure Security Center. If you do not have the Standard Tier subscription then you will need to [upgrade to this tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/security-center/) in order to use this feature.
