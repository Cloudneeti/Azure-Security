# Assume Breach Strategy

The guiding principle of your security strategy is to always “assume breach.” 

Microsoft Azure takes extensive security measures to protect against data breaches. These include both physical and logical security controls, as well as automated security processes, comprehensive information security and privacy policies, and security and privacy training for all personnel.


Azure responds to a potential data breach according to the security incident response process, which is a subset of the Microsoft Azure incident management plan. Azure’s security incident response is implemented using a five-stage process: Detect, Assess, Diagnose, Stabilize, and Close. The Security Incident Response Team may alternate between the diagnose and stabilize stages as the investigation progresses. An overview of the security incident response process is below:

However, it is the responsibility of your organization to implement the appropriate security strategy that protects your assets on the cloud.

## Guidance

Use the following guidance when implementing your security strategy:

- Ensure you harden your systems/servers.
- Implement [security access controls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-identity-management-best-practices) that will help ensure the right users are accessing the system.
- Implement an [endpoint protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sccm/protect/deploy-use/endpoint-protection) and [endpoint antimalware policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sccm/protect/deploy-use/endpoint-antimalware-policies) for your systems/servers. 
- Ensure you implement routine vulnerability scanning and remediation.
- Ensure your servers up-to-date with the latest security updates/patches.
