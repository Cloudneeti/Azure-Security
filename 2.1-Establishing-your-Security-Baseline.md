# Establishing your Security Baseline

A security policy defines the desired configuration of your workloads and helps ensure compliance with company or regulatory security requirements.  



In Azure Security Center, you can define policies for your Azure subscriptions to ensure compliance with company or regulatory security requirements an tailor them for your desired configuration of your workloads. Once you define policies for your Azure subscriptions, and adapt them to the type of workload or the sensitivity of your data, Security Center can provide security recommendations to your computer, networking, SQL & storage, and application resources. 


 


 


## Preparation 

- Ensure that you are a subscription owner, contributor or security administrator to enable and configure Security Center 


- [Enable Data Collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-enable-data-collection) in Security Center to collect security related data from Azure resources to monitor vulnerabilities and/or threats. 



 
## Guidance 

- Review the [Azure policy definitions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-policies#available-security-policy-definitions) to understand what is available in the default security policy of Azure security center 


- Determine which controls Security Center monitors and recommends by editing the [security policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-policies#edit-security-policies) based on your business requirements. 


- Use [Azure Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-azure-policy) to integrate with Security Center to create new definitions, define additional policies and assign policies across management groups 


- Ensure that you implement [email notifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-provide-security-contact-details) for your desired security policies so that Microsoft's security response center can notify your security administrators when a security issue/breach occurs. 


- In order to leverage advanced security capabilities below we recommend upgrading to Security Center [Standard Tier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-get-started#upgrade-to-the-standard-tier)  

  - Connected partner solutions
  - Security event collection and search 
  - Just in time VM Access  
  - Adaptive application controls 
  - Advanced threat detection for networks, VMs/servers, and Azure services  
  - Built-in and custom alerts  
  - Threat intelligence
