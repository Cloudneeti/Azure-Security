# Establishing your Security Baseline
Use the procedure described in this section to enable access to the Security Center for your subscription. Use the guidance information in this section to build and configure your security policy.
<br />
<br />

Use Azure Security Center to define security policies for your Azure subscriptions. Customize the policies according to your workload configuration.

Once you define policies for your Azure subscriptions and adapt them to the workload types or data protection requirements, Security Center can provide security-related recommendations for your computer, network, SQL and storage, and application resources. 
<br />
<br />
 
## Guidance 
- Review [Azure policy definitions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-policies#available-security-policy-definitions) to understand the Azure Security Center default security policy.

- Edit the [security policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-policies#edit-security-policies) and select the controls that Security Center monitors. Security Center provides security policy recommendations based on your selections.

- Use [Azure Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-azure-policy) to integrate with Security Center to create new definitions, define additional policies and assign policies across management groups 

- Enable [email notifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-provide-security-contact-details) for security policies you wish to monitor. Microsoft's security response center provides notifications to Security Administrators should a security-related incident occur.

- To leverage the advanced security capabilities listed below, upgrade to Security Center [Standard Tier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-get-started#upgrade-to-the-standard-tier)  

  **Advanced security capabilities**:
    - Connected partner solutions
    - Security event collection and search 
    - Just in time VM Access  
    - Adaptive application controls 
    - Advanced threat detection for networks, VMs/servers, and Azure services  
    - Built-in and custom alerts  
    - Threat intelligence  
<br />
<br />

## Preparation 
- You must be a Subscription Owner, Contributor or Security Administrator to enable and configure Security Center. 

- [Enable Data Collection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-enable-data-collection) in Security Center to collect security related data from Azure resources to monitor vulnerabilities and/or threats.
