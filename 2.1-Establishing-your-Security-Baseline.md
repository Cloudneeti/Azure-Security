# Establishing your Security Baseline
Use the procedure described in this section to enable access to the Security Center for your subscription. Use the guidance information in this section to build and configure your security policy.
<br />
<br />

A security policy defines the desired configuration of your workloads and helps to ensure compliance with company or regulatory security requirements.  

Use Azure Security Center to define security policies for your Azure subscriptions. You can customize the policies according to your desired workload configuration. 

Once you define policies for your Azure subscriptions and adapt them to the workload types or the sensitivity of your data, Security Center can provide security recommendations for your computer, network, SQL and storage, and application resources.
