# Delegation
Use the information and procedures described in this section to design and implement a delegation model for your subscription deployment.
<br />
<br />

Use Azure role based access controls (RBAC) to designate Administrators to serve different functions.

There are two types of RBAC roles:  
1. **Azure AD RBAC Roles**:  
  These role assignments permit access to various features. Depending on the role, Administrators can create or edit users, assign administrative roles to others, reset user passwords, manage user licenses, and manage domains.  
  Example roles: Global Administrator, Billing Administrator, Security Administrator.

2. **Azure RBAC Roles**:  
  These role assignments allow you to control access to resources in Azure. You canâ€™t modify the built-in roles, but you can create your own [custom roles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles to fit the specific needs of your organization.  
  Examples roles: Owner, Contributor, Reader.

## Guidance 
Use the following guidance to help your planning process for Azure AD and Azure RBAC Roles: 
<br />

**Guidance for Azure AD RBAC roles**:  
Use the following guidance to help start your planning process for Azure AD RBAC Roles: 

- Start planning the roles as described in: [Top 5 Azure AD RBAC Roles](https://github.com/nmcgregor/Azure-Security/blob/master/4.2.2-Top-5-Azure-AD-RBAC-Roles.md).
 
- When planning roles, compile a list of users or groups who require access. Using the list, identify the Azure AD role assignment for each user/group.  

- Use a Least Privileged Access model. Implementing this model will ensure that you allocate sufficient privileges to accomplish specified functions, but no more.  

- Minimize the number of people that are [Global Administrators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles-azure-portal#details-about-the-global-administrator-role). 

- Implement [Just in time administration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure#just-in-time-administrator-access) and manage roles using [Azure AD PIM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure). 
<br />

**Guidance for Azure RBAC Roles**:  
Use the following information to help start your planning process for Azure RBAC roles:

- Start planning with the [Top 10 Built-In Azure RBAC Roles](https://github.com/nmcgregor/Azure-Security/blob/master/4.2.3-Top-10-Built-In-Azure-RBAC-Roles.md) to avoid complexity. Complexity is usually a result of defining too many roles. 

- When planning roles, compile a list of users or groups who require access. Start small with key foundational roles and add roles as needed.

- Control the Admin/Co-Admin of a subscription using a managed identity. Don't assign Admin/Co-admin to a new subscription 
owner. Instead, use RBAC roles to provide owner rights to a group or individual. 

- Add Azure users to a group (for example, Application X Owners) in Active Directory. Use the synchronized group to provide 
group members with the appropriate rights to manage the resource group containing the application

- Follow the principle of granting the least privilege required to do the expected work. For example:
   - Deployment Group: Create a deployment group that is only able to deploy resources. 
   - Virtual Machine Management: Create a virtual machine group that is only able to restart VMs (for operations) 

- Implement [Just in time administration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-privileged-identity-management-configure#just-in-time-administrator-access) 

- Use Built-In Roles before Custom Roles. There are two primary reasons why these Custom Roles should be used: 
    - There is no existing built-in role to provide the role needed. 
    - An existing built-in role may exist, but gives away too many rights, and there is a need to reduce the rights to just the 
bare minimum

## Procedure: How to assign Azure AD RBAC roles
Use this procedure to assign an administrative role to a user in Azure AD or Azure:

1. Sign in to the [Azure AD admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com/)  
  Sign in as a Global Administrator for the directory.

2. Follow the steps in this link:  
 [Assign an Azure AD RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-users-assign-role-azure-portal) role o a user. 
<br />

## Procedure: How to modify Azure AD RBAC roles
Use this procedure to view, add or remove RBAC assignments in Azure AD.  
The Subscription Owner uses Azure Portal.  
Refer to [Top 5 Azure AD RBAC Roles](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Azure-Security/blob/master/4.2.1-Top-5-Azure-AD-RBAC-Roles.md) for recommended Azure AD patterns. 

1. Sign into the [Azure Portal](https://ea.azure.com):  
  Sign in with a Subscription Owner account.

2. Perform any of the following: 

   - To add access: [Use Role-Based Access Control to manage access to your Azure subscription resources - 
     Add Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal?toc=%252fazure%252factive-directory%252ftoc.json#add-access)
