# Securing Azure laaS Resources
Use the information described in this section when deploying security on your resources using the IaaS scenario.
<br />
<br />

In most Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) scenarios, [Azure virtual machines (VMs)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/) are the main workload for organizations that use cloud computing.  

With Azure, you can build security-enhanced, compliant solutions that: 

- Protect your virtual machines from viruses and malware 
- Encrypt your sensitive data 
- Secure network traffic between your virtual machines 
- Identify and detect threats 
- Meet compliance requirements 
<br />
<br />

## Guidance 
- Protect your virtual machines by implementing [authentication and access controls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-best-practices-vms#vm-authentication-and-access-control) to ensure that only authorized users are able to provision and access your virtual machines 

- Implement multiple virtual machines to ensure [high availability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-best-practices-vms#vm-availability-and-network-access) (HA) for mission critical applications. For instructions on how to implement HA, see:  [availability sets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/tutorial-availability-sets). 

- Control the network traffic flow between your virtual machines and the internet by implementing [network security groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-nsg) 

- Encrypt your data disks that are at rest (inactive data on your VM or storage account level). For further information, see: [Protect at rest in your virtual machines by enforcing data encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-best-practices-vms#protect-data-at-rest-in-your-vms-by-enforcing-encryption)  

- Ensure you [manage updates and monthly patching](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-best-practices-vms#manage-your-vm-updates) of your virtual machines 

- Implement [Azure Security Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security-center/security-center-intro) to safeguard your virtual machines from cyber threats 

- Monitor the performance of your virtual machines and ensure there are no issues that can lead to service disruption. A service outage violates the security principle of HA. Monitor VM access and use both a reactive and proactive approach to maintaining operations. React appropriately to issues as they occur. React proactively by monitoring baseline performance during normal operations. 

- Implement Resource locks across your VMs to prevent unwanted or accidental changes or deletion to a resource.
