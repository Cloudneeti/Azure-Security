# Implementing and Assume Breach Strategy
Use this information provided in this section to help implement your Assume Breach strategy position. 
<br />
<br />

The guiding principle of your security strategy is to always “assume breach.” 

Azure takes extensive security measures to protect against data breaches.  
These measures include:
- physical and logical security controls
- automated security processes
- comprehensive information 
- security and privacy policies
- security and privacy training for all personnel
<br />
<br />

Azure responds to a potential data breach according to the security incident response process. Azure’s security incident response uses a five-stage process described in: [Configuring Threat Detection](4.7-Configuring-Threat-Detection.md).

The Security Incident Response Team may alternate between the diagnose and stabilize stages in an incident investigation. An overview of the security incident response process is below:

However, it is the responsibility of your organization to implement the appropriate security strategy that protects your assets on the cloud.

## Guidance

Use the following guidance when implementing your security strategy:

- Clearly establish and enforce all policies and procedures. Many security incidents are accidentally created by IT personnel who have not followed or not understood change management procedures or have improperly configured security devices, such as firewalls and authentication systems. Your policies and procedures should be thoroughly tested to ensure that they are practical and clear and provide the appropriate level of security.
- Routinely assess vulnerabilities in your environment. Assessments should be done by a security specialist with the appropriate clearance to perform these actions i.e. (given administrator rights to the systems).
- Ensure you harden your systems/servers and implement [security access controls](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-identity-management-best-practices) that will help ensure the right users are accessing the system.
Develop, implement, and enforce a policy requiring strong passwords. You can learn more about passwords in "Enforcing Strong Password Usage Throughout Your Organization" in the Security Guidance Kit.
- Implement [Network Security Groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-create-nsg-arm-pportal) on your subnets of your virtual networks. 
- Routinely monitor and analyze network traffic and system performance.
- Routinely check all logs and logging mechanisms, including operating system event logs, application specific logs and intrusion detection system logs. 
- Implement an [endpoint protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sccm/protect/deploy-use/endpoint-protection) and [endpoint antimalware policies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sccm/protect/deploy-use/endpoint-antimalware-policies) for your systems/servers. 
- Support system and network auditing through processes such as vulnerability assessment and penetration testing
- Promote security awareness within the company to help prevent incidents from occurring in your organization.
- Create an [incident response plan](4.6-Incident-Response-Management.md)
