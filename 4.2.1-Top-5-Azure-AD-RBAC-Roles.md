Additional roles can be added as your organization adopts additional Office 365 services and as teams are added in the lifecycle management of the azure AD tenant. 

Listed below are the top five Azure AD RBAC Roles.

1. **Global Administrator**:  
  Has access to all administrative features in Azure Active Directory, as well as services that federate to Azure AD such as Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and Skype for Business Online. The individual who signs up for the Azure AD tenant automatically becomes a Global Administrator. Only Global Administrators can assign other administrator roles. There can be more than one Global Administrator in an organization. Global Administrators can reset the password for any user and all other administrators. 

2. **Security Administrator**:  
  Has all of the read-only privileges of the Security Reader role, plus the ability to manage configuration for security-related services:  

    - Azure Active Directory Identity Protection 

   - Azure Information Protection,  

   - Privileged Identity Management 

    - Office 365 Security & Compliance Center.
