# Business Continuity

As an organization you need to adopt a business continunity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy that keeps your data safe, and your apps and workloads up and running, when planned and unplanned outages occur.

Azure Recovery Services contribute to your BCDR strategy by providing two services:

  - **Site Recovery service**: Site Recovery helps ensure business continuity by keeping business apps and workloads running during outages. Site Recovery replicates workloads running on physical and virtual machines (VMs) from a primary site to a secondary location. When an outage occurs at your primary site, you fail over to secondary location, and access apps from there. After the primary location is running again, you can fail back to it.
  - **Backup service**: The [Azure Backup service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/backup/) keeps your data safe and recoverable by backing it up to Azure.


## Preparation Steps
- [Prepare Azure resources for replication of on-premises machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/tutorial-prepare-azure)
- If you are using VMWare, [Prepare your on-premises VMware servers for Disaster Recovery to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/vmware-azure-tutorial-prepare-on-premises)
- If you are using Hyper-V, [Prepare on-premises Hyper-V servers for Disaster Recovery to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/hyper-v-prepare-on-premises-tutorial)
- Review the [support requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/site-recovery/azure-to-azure-support-matrix) for all components.
 
## Guidance

- Use Recovery Plans in Azure Site Recovery to ensure that you have a systematic plan in place. For example, definig how machines fail over, and the sequence in which they start after failover. You can use recovery plans to do the following:
  - Model an app around its dependencies.
  - Automate recovery tasks to reduce RTO.
  - Verify that you're prepared for migration or disaster recovery by ensuring that your apps are part of a recovery plan.
  - Run test failover on recovery plans, to ensure disaster recovery or migration is working as expected.
